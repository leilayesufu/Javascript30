  **Day 4: Array cardio day 1 
  
  The task today was done solely in the javascript console to learn about some javascript methods
  i learnt about **console.table() , Array.filter() , Array.map() , Array.sort() , Array.reduce() **
  The **console.table()** shows the output on the console in a table format
  **Array.prototype.filter()** creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test provided in the functon given, it"s another way to return a value instead of an if statement returning **true**
  
  **Array.prototype.sort()** sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array, the default sort order is ascending string. Sort() also accepts the specific function that defines the sort order
  
  i also practiced array.reduce() and array.map()
