In this tutorial we used to sort method to sort a list of band names.

some band names had articles such as a/an/the in it and we wanted to sort it without it.

so we created a new function to remove the articles using .replace(), regular expression and .trim()

after sorting, we mapped the band array to an inner HTML we selected using .map() and .join('')
