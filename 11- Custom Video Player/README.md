**What i Learnt**
video.paused
video.currentTime
video.play()
video.pause()
.data- attribute
parseFloat()

The first thing we did was to get all the elements needed using query selector
then we built out functions to play, pause change the button while playing and pausing using .textcontent
i also built a function to skip using this.dataset.skip
we then hooked all the functions into event handlers.
