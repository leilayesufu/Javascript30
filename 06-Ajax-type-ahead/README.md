##terms and methods learnt

**change & keyup events**
**fetch() then() json()**
**Javascript promises**
**Regex: .match() replace() new RegExp()**
i also learnt more array methods such as **filter() map() push() join()**

The change and key up events are event listeners, the change event activates when we step out of the input. but the keyup events activates immediately.

fetch()- This api is used to extract information from a website, it returns a promise which a **.then()** method is then used to resolve the promise
.json() also returns a promise 

in regular expression, i learnt how to create a new Regex

const regex= new RegExp('wordToMatch',  'ig')
where ig are flags
i flag- ignores upper and lowercase
g flag- to extract more than one case
 
 .match() -  extracts the values of the words matched
